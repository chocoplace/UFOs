# **UFOs**

## Overview of the analysis: 
Create a webpage in HTML where a dynamic table of  UFO data is stored, organized and filtered from a JavaScript array. For the project I applied Bootstrap and HTML skills for visualizations.

### Resources

Software: VS Code, JavaScript, Bootstrap and HTML.

Data Source: [Data (data.js)](https://github.com/chocoplace/UFOs/blob/main/static/js/data.js) 

### Results

The results from the first part of the project can be seen on the following image: 

![First code](https://github.com/chocoplace/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/Result_first_code.png)

The code was refactored to show four additional filters in total the user will have the opportunity to search by: date, city, state, country and shape. 

![Example1](https://github.com/chocoplace/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/Result_challenge_code.png)

The webpage will be updated automatically with the search criteria after pressing "Enter". On the following images are presented two examples of the types of search the user can conduct on the webpage: the first the user only input the name of the city and on the second the user input the date, city and shape.

Finally, to clear the filter data to conduct a new search, the user will have to erase the information provided and press “Enter” to start over.

### Summary of the results and recomendations

Like many other websites the one created in this project has the potential to improve by addressing some drawbacks that would make it easier to use. 

Examples of drawbacks and recomendations on how to address them:

- *The search method is not all clear*. The user has to be familiar with the webpage search method to utilize the dynamic table. To make it more user friendly the developer can add a legend explaining how to use the filters or provide buttons for filtering and clear data.
  
  -  *The data input is restricted*. The user has to input the exact data since the filters are case sensitive. The developer can refactor the code to make it easier to search for date on the dynamic table. 
  
  -  *The duration of a sighting is important for some users*. Thinking as a user the duration of a sighthing might be as  important in some research. The developer can refactor the code to add the duration to the list of filtering data. 

  End.
