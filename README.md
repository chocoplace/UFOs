# **UFOs**

## Overview of the analysis: 
Create a webpage in HTML where a dynamic table of  UFO data is stored, organized and filtered from a JavaScript array. For the project I applied Bootstrap and HTML skills for visualizations.

### Resources

Software: VS Code, JavaScript, Bootstrap and HTML.

Data Source: [Data (data.js)](https://github.com/chocoplace/UFOs/blob/main/static/js/data.js) 

### Results

The results from the first part of the project can be seen on the following image:

The code was refactored to show four additional filters in total the user will have the opportunity to search by: date, city, state, country and shape.

The webpage will be updated automatically with the search criteria after pressing "Enter". 


Finally, to clear the filter data for a new search, the user will have to erase the information provided and press “Enter” to start over.
